# Pong-Game

This is a school project where we individually developped a software to implement a one player Pong game against the computer. We created a graphics program for the ball to interact with its environment by simulating real-world simple physics and implemented a graphical user interface for the player to interact with the game.

In this project, I used the Java programming language with the ACM.jar package in the Eclipse IDE.
